# PROJECT 4 OVERVIEW

---

This full stack application will make use of a heroku hosted database to display my guild's collection of collectables by person.

## USER STORIES

---

As someone who is used to hosting in-game events to hunt for collectables and nik-nacks it would be nice to have a searchable database to store this information, rather than having to defer to a multipaged spreadsheet.

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

---

This full stack application will have a REACT front end, utilizing bootstrap to display information from a database that is filterable by expansion pack (and thus specific set of collectables) and with the ability to display a character's collection in it's entirety.

The back end database will be (placeholder) based and will have a main "player" that will reference each set of collectables and store what each player has.
